Question 1
344. Reverse Strings

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.
*/

//Solution 

#include<algorithm>
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) 
    {
        reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
    }
};

/*
Question 2

557. Reverse Word in String III

Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.


Example 1:

Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"

Example 2:

Input: s = "God Ding"
Output: "doG gniD"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s contains printable ASCII characters.
s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
There is at least one word in s.
All the words in s are separated by a single space.

//Solution
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) 
    {
        size_t front = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i <= s.length(); ++i){
            if(i == s.length() || s[i] == ' '){
                reverse(&s[front], &s[i]);
                front = i + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return s;
    }
};
